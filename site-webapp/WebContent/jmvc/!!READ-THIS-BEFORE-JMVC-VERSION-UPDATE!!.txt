!!!Fix on steal.js!!!
=====================

on Line 2056 This code snippet:

// either instrument is in this page (if we're the window opened from steal.browser), or its opener has it
if( options.instrument || (!options.browser && win.top && win.top.opener && 
              win.top.opener.steal && win.top.opener.steal.options.instrument) ) {
       // force startFiles to load before instrument
       steals.push(function(){}, {
              src: "steal/instrument",
              waits: true
       });
}

}catch(err){
 
}

THIS IS A MAJOR FIX. 
WITHOUT IT THE WEBSITE WILL BREAK WHEN REFERENCED BY EXTERNAL SITES.
